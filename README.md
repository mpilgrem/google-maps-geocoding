Haskell bindings to the Google Geocoding API (formerly Maps Geocoding API)

This respository has no connection with Google Inc. or its affiliates.

The
[Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding)
provides a direct way to access geocoding and reverse geocoding services via an
HTTP request. This library provides bindings in Haskell to that API.

NB: The use of the Google Geocoding API services is subject to the
[Google Maps Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/),
which terms restrict the use of content. End Users' use of Google Maps is
subject to the then-current Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service
at https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html and Google Privacy Policy at
https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.

In the light of the 'Requirements for Using the Services - End User Terms and
Privacy Policy' clauses of those terms, by using the library in this repository
you are agreeing to be bound by Google's Terms of Service.
